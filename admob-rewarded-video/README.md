AdMob Rewarded Video Codelab
==============================
Rewarded (or "reward-based") video ads are full screen video ads that users
have the option of watching in full in exchange for in-app rewards. 

This codelab will walk you through integrating rewarded video ads into an existing
Android or iOS mobile app, including the design considerations, as well as implementation details,
to follow the best practices for rewarded video ads.
