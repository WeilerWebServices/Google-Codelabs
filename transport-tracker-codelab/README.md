Google Transport Tracker Codelab
================================

[Google Transport Tracker](https://github.com/googlemaps/transport-tracker) is a set
of applications designed to track a range of moving assets (such as vehicles) and 
visualize them on a live map. This codelab is designed to introduce you to the core
techniques and APIs used in constructing the Google Transport Tracker.

**Note:** This application implements asset tracking. For use in a production environment, you therefore need a [Google Maps APIs Premium Plan license](
https://developers.google.com/maps/pricing-and-plans/). For more information, see the [Google Maps APIs terms of service](https://developers.google.com/maps/terms#section_10_4).
